  ###Scenario
  The app is developed for museums which want to organize events for the arrival of a new painting, or for the opening of a new exhibition; in this case, our app could be used by the “Museo del Novecento” in Milan for a temporary event organized for the arrival of a new Pollock piece in the museum. The app can be used everywhere in Milan (for now). 

For the first version of the app, we decided to limit the gameplay range in the city of Milan and the main theme of the app is Pollock. 
We thought that the app could be declined in various artists’ styles depending on new arrivals of works of art in the museum.

We decided to develop Pollock's as the first modality since, recalling its style, it leaves the user a lot of freedom to express his creativity through free paths and colors.

<ul>
  <li>
    <b> Mouse interaction </b></br>
    In the desktop interface the main interaction is with the mouse which becomes the brush. As you enter the scribble sketch, you can simply draw lines by moving the mouse.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b> Touch interaction </b></br>
    On the mobile devices the users can draw by touching the screen.  
  </li>
  <li>  
    <b> iframe </b></br>
     We chose to use an iframe in the desktop and not to create a new interface in order to maintain the proportions of the sketches and an overall consistency of content. For this reason we created an iframe with a 16:9 ratio, which is the ratio of most mobile phones.
