    <b> Mouse interaction </b></br>
    In the desktop interface the main interaction is with the mouse which becomes the brush. As you enter the scribble sketch, you can simply draw lines by moving the mouse.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b> Touch interaction </b></br>
    On the mobile devices the users can draw by touching the screen.  
  </li>
  <li>  
    <b> iframe </b></br>
     We chose to use an iframe in the desktop and not to create a new interface in order to maintain the proportions of the sketches and an overall consistency of content. For this reason we created an iframe with a 16:9 ratio, which is the ratio of most mobile phones.
