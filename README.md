  ### Scenario
  The app is developed for museums which want to organize events for the arrival of a new painting, or for the opening of a new exhibition; in this case, our app could be used by the “Museo del Novecento” in Milan for a temporary event organized for the arrival of a new Pollock piece in the museum. The app can be used everywhere in Milan (for now). 

For the first version of the app, we decided to limit the gameplay range in the city of Milan and the main theme of the app is Pollock. 
We thought that the app could be declined in various artists’ styles depending on new arrivals of works of art in the museum.

We decided to develop Pollock's as the first modality since, recalling its style, it leaves the user a lot of freedom to express his creativity through free paths and colors.

### Aim of the project
The aim of the project is to allow people to keep in touch with art while having fun while walking and cycling. It’s an original way to promote art and to advertise the Museo del Novecento. Museums often do not place themselves in a direct way towards users; it follows therefore that only a few fans remain in contact with the news and events organized by the museum.

### Idea and concept
Since the project’s brief was to create something collaborative, the first thing first that came in our mind was to develope an app that would link art and people. 

We also taught that GPS’ based apps are so popular nowadays (we can think about Pokémon Go or Strava) and they are easy and fun to use; GPS’ based games promote a way of playing that differs from the use of the classic consoles connected to the TVs: GPS’s games promote outdoor playing.

It’s also a recent trend for museums all over the world to develop apps for their visitors to make their visit an interactive experience.
